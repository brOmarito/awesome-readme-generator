# awesome-readme-generator
The Awesome Readme Generator was created to streamline creating a Readme! It can be a little annoying having to keep writing Readmes from scratch so I created a quick JS app that will take inputs from the terminal and create an organized Readme.md for you! All you have to do is rename the Readme and move it to the location you want it.

## What was the point?
As I mentioned above, this is something that consistently comes up when creating new repos. So the point is to make it a little easier and not have to worry so much about the formatting.\
Other than that, it was to get more experience working with JS. Getting to work with node and npm a little bit as well.

## Lessons Learned
Definitely was good practice working with JS and if I got a better grasp on anything in particular, it would be creating separate modules and then importing them into my main JS file.

## Usage Information
Glad you asked! Take a look at the video I recorded on how to use the Awesome ReadMe Generator!\

## Improvements
I want to add the ability for the user to give the directory of where the file should be created as well as the name.
